# Signal-Lights-for-Cyclist-Through-Voice-Turn-and-Manual-Switch
Arduino voice command to light up turn signals.


Due to covid-19 pandemic most people switch to a much safer and healthier way of transportation which is riding a bike or much known as cycling. But along with it, we can say that more cyclists is proportional to more accidents and incidents on the road occurring to bike commuters. With it we came up with a product to resolve the common cause of bicycle related accidents. Usual cause of bicycle related accidents is misunderstanding about bicycle turns and out of balance due to manual hand signals for cyclists. In order to solve the top cause of the problem we came up with voice recognition and manual switch activated bicycle turn signals it will definitely solve the problem because we put it in a vest which is much easier for other motorist to see and we make it voice activated so that cyclists do not need to raise their hands anymore in making turns.
